# TicTacToe challenge

This repository contains my response to the TicTacToe challenge test. 
Note that I have used the HTML/CSS that belongs to somebody else.
However, I have used my own JavaScript to build the logic of the game.


*Here is the codepen I have used for the HTML and CSS*
https://codepen.io/coreydunkin/pen/zqrud


# Two JS "classes" and a controller 
Two javascript "classes" run the logic of the game (game.js and whowins.js), whereas interface.js
 controls the interactions with the browser. (All files to be found under lib/js)


# Jasmine is used for testing 
Tests can be found under the JasmineTest folder: lib/JasmineTest. You can run the test on terminal with the following command :

```
npm test

```

# In order to run the application 

From the root fold type on terminal : 

```
open index.html
```

The browser will then be displayed with a 3 by 3 grid to play tictactoe.
